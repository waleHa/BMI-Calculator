#  BMI Calculator

## My Goal


I made a Body Mass Index calculator. Based on the userâ€™s weight and height it will calculate their body mass and give a piece of health advice depending on whether if they have eaten healthy food or if they have eaten too many unhealthy food. 

## What I learned

* How to create multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
* Optional binding, optional chaining and the nil coalescing operator.
* How to create classes and difference between classes and structs. 
* Pass by value vs. pass by reference. 
* Formatting Strings. 
* Color literals.
* The difference between objects created from classes with instances of Structs
* The MVC design pattern
